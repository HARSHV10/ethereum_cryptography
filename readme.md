## ECDSA and Ethereum-Cryptography Fund Transfer Project
This project is aimed at providing a secure method of transferring funds using ECDSA and Ethereum cryptography.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a secure and efficient method for transferring funds between parties using ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) and Ethereum cryptography. The use of these two technologies ensures that the transfer of funds is secure and that the transaction is validated on the Ethereum blockchain.This is the Project that 
 
### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
